# General Introduction
RISC-V, as the youngest member of the Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) family, possesses   
several advantages that other instruction sets lack. Over the years, the development of the RISC-V   
instruction set has been thriving, showing vibrant momentum in both academic and industrial fields.  
This is the reason that we believe that RISC-V is a promising area.

Our research primarily implies RISC-V on multi-core interconnection, processor soft error resilience  
strategy, and general network processor architecture. In a project sponsored by Nanjing Qinheng   
Microelectronics, we have designed the interconnection sturcture and programming framework for   
multi-core RISC-V architecture in edge computing scenarios, and implemented a complete runnable   
prototype of a multi-core processor. After that, we continued our collaboration on exploring   
processor soft error resilience strategy and proposed a set of soft error detection and recovery   
mechanisms in a RISC-V in-order single-core processor.This innovation significantly improved the   
soft error reslience with reasonable performance and resource overhead. This work has resulted in   
one patent publication, and we plan to publish a paper. Currently, we are collaborating with ZTE   
Microelectronics to implement the RISC-V instruction set in a general network processor, and   
propose a new set of network processor instruction sets based on RISC-V later.
