Welcome to the Quantitative Analysis Group!

The Quantitative Analysis Group is committed to evaluating the performance of computer devices through data metrics, thus proposing optimization decisions at hardware level.

We employ methodologies, including benchmarking, simulation, modeling, etc., to assess and explore hardware designs at the micro-architectural level, particularly processors and memory.

If you are interested in learning and working on Quantitative Analysis or Computer Architecture, please consider joining our group.
